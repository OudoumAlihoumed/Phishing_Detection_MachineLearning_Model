# Phishing_Detection_MachineLearning_Model

Developed a machine learning system to detect and mitigate phishing attacks by classifying URLs as either legitimate or malicious. The project used a dataset of 10,000 URLs with features such as URL length, number of dots, and subdomain levels. Several classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated. The system accurately predicts phishing attempts, enhancing cybersecurity.
